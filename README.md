**Add persistent task management to any AI coding assistant in Cursor, Windsurf, and other IDEs.**

This MCP server replicates Claude Code's todo system, giving your AI assistant the ability to:

- Track complex multi-step tasks across sessions
- Break down large features into manageable pieces
- Remember progress when you switch between projects
- Enforce single in-progress task focus

## Why You Want This

Without task management, AI assistants:

- ❌ Forget what they were working on between conversations
- ❌ Lose track of multi-step implementations
- ❌ Can't prioritize or organize complex work
- ❌ Leave tasks half-finished when you switch contexts

With this MCP server:

- ✅ **Persistent memory** - Tasks survive across sessions
- ✅ **Project-scoped** - Each workspace gets its own todo list
- ✅ **Automatic tracking** - AI knows when to create/update tasks
- ✅ **Progress visibility** - See exactly what's completed/pending
- ✅ **Focus enforcement** - Only one task in-progress at a time

## Quick Start

**No installation required!** Just add this to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-manager": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["claude-todo-emulator"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **Cursor**: Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root
- **Other IDEs**: Add to your MCP configuration file

**Restart your IDE** and try: _"Create a todo list for adding user authentication"_

The system automatically downloads the package and sets up everything on first use!

## What You Get

Once configured, your AI assistant will automatically:

**Create todos for complex tasks:**

```
You: "Add dark mode support with user preferences"
AI: "I'll create a todo list for this multi-step feature:
- ✅ Add theme context and state management
- 🔄 Create dark mode CSS variables and styles
- ⏳ Build settings UI for theme switching
- ⏳ Add persistence to localStorage
- ⏳ Update existing components for theme support"
```

**Track progress visually:**

```
You: "What's the status on the authentication system?"
AI: "Current authentication tasks:
- ✅ Set up JWT middleware
- ✅ Create login/signup endpoints
- 🔄 Building user profile management (in progress)
- ⏳ Add password reset flow
- ⏳ Implement role-based permissions"
```

**Maintain focus:**

```
You: "Let's also add email notifications"
AI: "I'll add that to the todo list, but let me finish the current user profile task first to maintain focus."
```
